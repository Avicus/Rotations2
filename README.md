## Avicus Rotations

This repository stores map rotations for the servers on The Avicus Network. Each file listed under the "servers" directory corresponds to a server on Avicus and contains the sequence of maps for that server.

### Suggesting a Change

Community changes are **welcomed.** We allow you to propose rotation changes: be sure to list any applicable replacements that are the same gamemode as its predecessor by creating an issue, or by creating a pull request. We encourage you to also vote on rotation proposals using :+1: or :-1: with reasons listed on why the change would either be good, or bad. Please use common sense when suggesting maps.

New servers/gamemodes are **not** to be suggested here for proposed gamemode rotations. Instead, use the [forums](http://avicus.net/forums) for your ideas.
